## Platform Improvements
## General Availability for New Regions
Now when you create a new site on Pantheon, you can select from one of four regions across the globe, including Australia, Canada, and the European Union. For more info see [Pantheon Site Regions and Data Residency](/regions).

## DNS Recommendations Update

Pantheon now recommends A/AAAA records instead of CNAME records. This change is to reduce complexity, confusion, and address a few edge cases introduced with CNAMEs. For example, the use of an MX or TXT record prevents the use of a CNAME. If you are already using a CNAME you can continue to do so or you can update to A/AAAA records as shown on the dashboard.
