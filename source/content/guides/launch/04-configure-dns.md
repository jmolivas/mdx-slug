In this lesson we'll configure DNS and provision [free, automated HTTPS](/https/) on Pantheon.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

If your site is already live and serving HTTPS traffic, and will require HTTPS on Pantheon, return to [Connect a Domain Name](/guides/launch/domains/) and complete the steps to pre-provision HTTPS before updating DNS to avoid downtime.

</Alert>

These instructions cover the common `example.com` and `www.example.com` domain configuration. For other domain configurations, see [Platform and Custom Domains](/domains/#custom-domains).
